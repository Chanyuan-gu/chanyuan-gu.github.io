      <h1>About me!</h1>
      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Fumiko Hoeft in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Connecticut. I completed my PhD with Ping Li at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p>
      <p>My research interests center around the neurocognitive mechanisms of language comprehension in bilingual speakers and children. Using multimodal data and various neuroimaging techniques, I aim to uncover how the brain supports reading, listening, and audiovisual comprehension, along with the impacts of individual differences. I am also interested in the association between human brains and large language models during language comprehension. Ultimately, my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how people learn and use language.</p>
